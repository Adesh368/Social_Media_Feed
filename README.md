## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for building a modern Flutter social media app.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed (version 3.0 or later recommended)  
- An IDE like VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ  
- Basic knowledge of Dart and Flutter development  


## Usage Instructions

- **View Posts Feed:**  
The home screen displays a scrollable timeline of recent posts. Tap a post card to open its detail screen.

- **Search Posts:**  
Use the search bar at the top to filter posts by keyword, instantly narrowing down the feed.

- **View Post Details and Comments:**  
On the post detail screen, read the full post body and browse comments. Add a comment using the input field at the bottom.

- **Create a New Post:**  
Tap the "+" floating button to create a new post. Enter a title and content; your post will appear at the top of the feed.

- **View User Profiles:**  
Tap an authorâ€™s avatar or name to navigate to their profile. See their details and all their posts.

- **Dark Mode:**  
The app supports both light and dark themes, following your system settings.

- **Offline Support:**  
If offline, previously cached posts and users will load automatically.

## Architecture Overview

The app is built using **Flutter** and **Riverpod** for state management, following a modular architecture:


**Key Concepts:**
- `AsyncNotifier` + Riverpod for async data fetching and optimistic UI updates.
- Persistent local cache with SharedPreferences for robust offline experiences.
- Real-time updates simulated with timers for demo purposes; hook to real sockets if needed.
- Responsive layout helper for device-specific adaptations.
